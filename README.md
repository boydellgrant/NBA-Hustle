This project explores hustle in the NBA, first creating a hustle metric based on six statistics found through the NBA statistics website. 
Using this metric, we discovered the top hustlers in the NBA, both in terms of individual players and teams. Using our discoveries, we compared 
this hustle metric to a variety of other variables, looking for correlations via linear regression.

Techniques/Approaches (R): Correlation Analysis, Visualizations, Metric Building
